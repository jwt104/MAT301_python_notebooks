# MAT301_python_notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks for MAT301 numerical methods in Python (JT 2022)

Part of the MAT301 course is designed to illustrate the mathematics of several numerical techniques which students may encounter in future.
MAT301 aims to have students carry out several iterations of the schemes by hand, to demonstrate the way they work. This process, working by hand, will be tested in the exam.

These codes are for additional context once students are able to carry out the mathematical steps: the ultimate goal is that students are able to create numerical schemes to solve problems in future, using whatever software or coding language is necessary. 
These codes should NOT be used in the exam or replace students use of a pen and paper approach to tutorial problems. However, students *are* encouraged to use these codes to verify their tutorial solutions after they have already been solved using pen and paper.

Aspects of the notebooks make use of images, code snippets and other aspects of Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientis, found at https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html (February 2022), all rights reserved.
