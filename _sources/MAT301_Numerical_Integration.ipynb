    "## Motivation\n",
    "Many laws of motion (for example Newton's Laws) require differentiation or integration in order to extract different information. For example: integrating a displacement in time yields a velocity. The ability to integrate functions between two points is extremely useful in video games programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $f(x)$, we want to approximate the integral of $f(x)$ over the total **interval**, $[a,b]$. The following figure illustrates the area this generates. \n",

    "<img src=\"https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/_images/21.01.1-Illustration_integral.png\" alt=\"Illustration integral\" title=\"Illustration of the integral. The integral from a to b of the function f is the area below the curve (shaded in grey).\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we assume that the interval is broken up (\"discretised\"). Our independent variable, $x$, will comprise $N+1$ points with spacing, $h = \\dfrac{b - a}{n}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote each point in $x$ using the subscript \"n\", i.e. $x_n$ (which is common for this type of algorithm), beginning with 0 ($x_0 = a$) and ending with n ($x_n = b$). Note: There are $N+1$ grid points because the count starts at $x_0$. We also assume we have a function, $f(x)$, that can be computed for any of the grid points, or that we have been given the function implicitly as $f(x_n)$. The interval $[x_n, x_{n+1}]$ is referred to as a **subinterval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods exist to approximate the area under the function or $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$. Each method approximates the area under $f(x)$ for each subinterval by a shape for which it is easy to compute the exact area, and then sums the area contributions of every subinterval. In MAT301 we learned about Simpson's Rule and Trapezium Rule, which we will detail below.\n"
