    "Lots of laws of motion (for example Newton's Laws) require differentiation or integration in order to extract different information. Integrating a displacement in time yields a velocity. The ability to integrate functions between two points is extremely useful in video games programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $f(x)$, we want to approximate the integral of $f(x)$ over the total **interval**, $[a,b]$. The following figure illustrates this area. To accomplish this goal, we assume that the interval has been discretized into a numeral grid, $x$, consisting of $n+1$ points with spacing, $h = \\frac{b - a}{n}$. Here, we denote each point in $x$ by $x_i$, where $x_0 = a$ and $x_n = b$. Note: There are $n+1$ grid points because the count starts at $x_0$. We also assume we have a function, $f(x)$, that can be computed for any of the grid points, or that we have been given the function implicitly as $f(x_i)$. The interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ is referred to as a **subinterval**.\n",

In MAT301 we learned about Simpson's Rule and Trapezium Rule, which we will detail below.\n"
