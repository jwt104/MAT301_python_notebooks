If we assume that $x_0$ is \"close enough\" to $x_r$, then we can improve upon it by taking the linear approximation of $f(x)$ around $x_0$, which is a line, and finding the intersection of this line with the x-axis. Written out, the linear approximation of $f(x)$ around $x_0$ is $f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + f^{\\prime}(x_0)(x-x_0)$. Using this approximation, we find $x_1$ such that $f(x_1) = 0$.
